# WebDev--Final-Project-btm495
This repo includes the entire project for BTM495 (Information Systems Design and Implementation) 

The folder includes files for 2 different deliverables: use cases/stories and functional diagrams. 
Altough this was a group project, 100% of the code was written by me as I was the designated programmer for the project
